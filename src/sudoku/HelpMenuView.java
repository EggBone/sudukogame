Step 2: Create a new class for the “Help” menu and call it HelpMenuView. This
class is responsible for displaying and retrieving the end user's input
selection and is often referred to as the "view" layer.  It must contain:

    *A function to display the help menu,
    *A function to get the player's input selection
    *A function to validate that the selection entered was valid. Use an
    if-else-if ladder or a switch statement to determine if the selection
    is valid. Use a do-while statement to loop until the end user (player) 
    enters a valid selection.

Step 4:  Modify the HelpMenuView class to call the appropriate action
function in the HelpMenuControl class.
